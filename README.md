This project explores the anatomy of a hit song using data science. Using a dataset of top Spotify tracks from 2010 to 2019, we analyzed various audio features to identify patterns that contribute to chart-topping success. The goal is to provide aspiring musicians with data-driven insights to help them craft songs with a higher potential for commercial popularity.

🔍 Problem Statement
An aspiring musician seeks to create a song that performs well on the Billboard charts. To support their creative journey, we analyzed historical hit songs to answer key questions like:

What is the ideal tempo (BPM)?

How energetic or danceable should the song be?

What emotional tone (valence) resonates with listeners?

Should the song be acoustic or electronic?

What genres dominate the charts?
